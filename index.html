                    The flute can be perceived as a simple instrument, but the physics and acoustics of the flute are quite interesting. Upon understand the acoustics of the instrument, flutists can become better performers and teacher. The basic way to create sound on the flute is learned upon picking up the instrument for the first time. To make sound, flutists blow a column of air that vibrates into the tone hole, creating a sound when it strikes the other edge of the tone hole. The column of air resonates more readily at certain frequencies, and these resonances determine the playing frequency and the pitch of the notes. As you learn to play the flute, you learn to adjust the speed of the air blown into the hole to match the frequency of the note that you’re playing. Flutists usually do this involuntarily, adjusting the air speed until they get a sound out. Notes of different frequencies resonate depending on the column of air and the size of the aperture. The flute is an open pipe, so as you open each tone hole on a basic Boehm flute, the pitch goes up by a half step. However, there are cut-off frequencies for the flute, because the higher up in frequency you go, the less resonant the notes become. At a certain cut-off frequency, a human just can’t blow air fast enough to excite the high fundamental frequency, which is why there is a high-register cut-off range for the flute (Wolfe). Most flutists can’t play many notes after the C6 pitch; however, in some contemporary styles, flutists must play notes above the C6, which is incredibly difficult.

                  One of the most common questions when buying a flute is: does the material or metal the flute is made out of matter to the sound of the instrument? If you ask most flutists, their answer will be yes. However, scientific experiments have proved time and time again that the metal a flute is made from does not contribute significantly to the sound of the instrument itself. Flutists will claim that they sound better on a gold or silver flute, but if you were to blindfold a person and have them play each instrument without knowing the material, odds are, there will not be a large difference in sound. People tend to “see” the difference rather than “hear” the difference. However, a combination of factors together, including face shape, embouchure shape, and the mechanics of the instrument can influence the tone of a flute, and the material is one of those factors. It will not make or break a difference in the tone, though. You can see in the graph of an experiment conducted with flutes of gold, silver, and platinum flutes, that no extreme differences were found the sounds of all the instruments comparatively (Linortner). The differences in tone color, sound, and dynamic range really depend on the player, not on the material of the instrument. Therefore, being able to see the material of the flute leads to the misconception that, for flutes, the instrument itself is the vibrating body that creates the sound. However, we know that the vibrating column of air is what creates the sound, and that the instrument is just a tool to deliver the sound through.

                    Recently, I have heard buzz in the flute world about a particular tool called the “lefreQue.” This tool claims to be a sound solution tool that acts as a “sound bridge” to “repair sound breaches that occur in different parts of the instrument.” For flutes, the lefreQue tool is to be used in the top portion of the flute, where the headjoint makes contact with the body mechanism of the instrument. The lefreQue tool is available for most woodwind instruments, including flutes, saxophones, and clarinets. Spectral analysis studies have been done on a piccolo with a lefreQue tool attached to it. Upon concluding this study, it was found that certain notes came out in a higher frequency (in all ranges) with the lefreQue tool than without it. The change in higher frequency of the note led to the perception of a brighter sound and improved tone quality of the notes. The lefreQue website itself claims that, “Many investigators maintain that the tonal quality or brightness is correlated with the increase in power of high frequencies” (lefreQue). This is a relatively new sound tool and more research should be conducted on it to see whether it is worth the investment; however, it is interesting to see the types of tools out there for professional musicians looking to enhance their tone and make their tone more pleasing for the listener.

                  After learning about the ear and its delicate mechanisms, I have been curious to see the impact of constant flute and piccolo noise to the ear in the long term. It is important for professional musicians to care for their ears, so it is equally as important for musicians to know the decibel threshold level of safe hearing for their instrument. Flutes and piccolos are held extremely close to the ear (up to 6 inches), so they can easily cause hearing damage, especially because the loud sounds made are amplified after being so close to the ear. With repeated exposure, the damage done to the ear can become permanent. This is called Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). There is no known cure, so it is really important to know the maximum amount of dB you can expose your ears to while playing your instrument, and to buy appropriate hearing protection. Most piccolo players have adequate hearing protection that they use in the orchestra itself. Also, hearing loss begins in the higher frequencies, so as you attain more hearing damage, the higher frequency notes seem softer than the lower frequency notes. <br><br>
Most people suffering from NIHL have a lack of response in sounds ranging from 3000 to 6000 Hz. When diagnosing NIHL, audiologists often notice a dip in hearing around 4000 Hz. Another warning sign of NIHL is TTS – Temporary Threshold Shift. This is just a decreased sensitivity to louder sounds, leading to a ringing in the ears or dullness in the ear after being exposed to loud sounds. You can compare in the table below, the various decibel thresholds for different sounds compared to flutes and piccolos. It should be noted that, a flute or piccolo at mezzo-forte is of a similar destructiveness to a train-whistle heard from 500 feet away. This is quite alarming for professional musicians, as the decibel level threshold for flutists means that these musicians cannot play their flutes for long periods of time before reaching the threshold. For most people, sounds of any duration are safe at about 75 dB(A) or under. Hearing damage begins after 8 hours of exposure to 85 dB(A) sounds. If you know you will be exposed to that much sound (for example, if you are a professional flutist), you should invest in adequate hearing protection. Also, the ears require up to 14 hours of rest after exposure to high intensity sounds in order to recover properly (Krantz).

                    In conclusion, there are many aspects of the flute and the acoustics of the flute worth exploring. I have looked at certain topics, such as the basic physics of air while playing the flute, the materials of the flute, bridging sound gaps on the instrument itself, and hearing loss while playing the flute. However, there is a world of knowledge ready to learn about when it comes to flute acoustics.
